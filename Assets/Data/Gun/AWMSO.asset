  GunDescription: The Accuracy International Arctic Warfare rifle is a bolt-action
    sniper rifle designed and manufactured by the British company Accuracy International.
    It has proved popular as a civilian, police, and military rifle since its introduction
    in the 1980s. The rifles have features that improve performance in extremely
    cold conditions (which gave the rifle its name) without impairing operation in
    less extreme conditions.
